# MPC-for-AUVs-Python-Examples
This repository provides illustrations of the implementation of the MPC algorithms from Chapter 5 of the book "**Robust Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles**".

The Python code is provided to demonstrate that the techniques used in the MATLAB implementation can be translated into the Python platform, which is freely and widely accessible. The script implements a velocity form LPVMPC1 controller for AUV dynamic positioning as investigated in Chapter 5. In addition, the LPVMPC2 algorithm is implemented and tested on a hover-type AUV, specifically the BlueROV. This further demonstrates that the 6-DoF algorithms proposed in this book are applicable not only to torpedo-type AUVs but also to other classes, such as hover-type vehicles.
