# MPC-for-AUVs-Python-Examples
This repository provides illustrations of the implementation of the MPC algorithms from Chapter 5 of the book "Robust Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles".

The LPVMPC1 was applied to the Naminow-D AUV used in the book, while LPVMPC2 was applied to the BlueROV example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm even for 
hover-type AUVs.
